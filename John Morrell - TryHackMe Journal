Notes During the Room:                                                                                                                     Introduction to Linux:
Linux is an open-source operating system kernel developed by Linus Torvalds.
It is widely used in servers, embedded systems, and as a desktop operating system.
Basic Commands:
ls: List directory contents.
cd: Change directory.
pwd: Print working directory.
mkdir: Make directories.
rmdir: Remove directories.
touch: Create empty files.
cp: Copy files and directories.
mv: Move or rename files and directories.
rm: Remove files or directories.
File Permissions:
Files and directories in Linux have three sets of permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x).
Permissions are set for user (owner), group, and others.
Commands like chmod are used to change permissions.
File Navigation:
Use cd to navigate between directories.
. represents the current directory.
.. represents the parent directory.
~ represents the home directory of the current user.
Text Editing:
Common text editors include nano and vi (or vim).
nano is beginner-friendly with on-screen help.
vi is more powerful but has a steeper learning curve.
File Operations:
Use cat to display contents of a file.
grep is used for searching patterns in files.
echo prints text to the terminal or a file.
Process Management:
ps: Displays information about active processes.
kill: Terminates a process by specifying its PID.





Important Takeaways:                                                                                                                 Understanding Linux Basics:
Linux is an open-source operating system known for its stability, security, and flexibility.
It uses a terminal interface where commands are typed to perform tasks.
Navigating the File System:
Use commands like ls to list directory contents, cd to change directories, and pwd to display the current directory path.
Understanding relative paths (., ..) and the home directory shortcut (~) is crucial for efficient navigation.
File and Directory Operations:
Commands like mkdir (make directory), touch (create empty file), cp (copy), mv (move/rename), and rm (remove) are essential for managing files and directories.
File Permissions:
Every file and directory in Linux has permissions (read, write, execute) for the owner, group, and others.
Use chmod to modify permissions and chown to change ownership.
Text Editing:
Basic text editors like nano are easy to use for beginners.
Advanced editors like vi (or vim) offer more features but have a steeper learning curve.
Process Management:
ps displays active processes, and kill terminates processes by their PID.
Shell Features:
Linux shells (like bash) offer features such as command history (history), wildcard expansion (*), and redirection of input/output (>, >>, <).
